### Task
Given the database schema and an SQL query, i.e., SQL_2, briefly describe how it works.

### Database Schema
The query will run on a database with the following schema:
Table People, columns = [ *, playerID, nameFirst, nameLast ]
Table Batting, columns = [ *, palyerID, yearID ]
Table Fielding, columns = [ *, playerID, yearID ]
Table Pitching, columns = [ *, playerID, yearID ]

Primary_keys = [ People.playerID ]
Foreign_keys = [ People.playerID = Batting.playerID, People.playerID = Fielding.playerID, People.playerID = Pitching.playerID ]
